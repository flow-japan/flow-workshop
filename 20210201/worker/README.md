# tokens-js

API that sends transactions to the Flow Blockchain, using the [flow-js-sdk](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/).
This API currently supports:

- Minting Kibbles (fungible token)
- Minting Kitty Items (non-fungible token)
- Creating Sale Offers for Kitty Items

### Setup

- Install npm dependencies:

```
npm install
```

- Run docker:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

- Create a `.env` file based out of `.env.example`. Refer to `Creating a new Flow Account on Testnet` section below in order to
  setup your private key for the `MINTER_PRIVATE_KEY` variable.

- Start app:

```
npm run start:dev
```

Note that when the API starts, it will automatically run the database migrations for the configured `DATABASE_URL` url.

- Start workers / flow event handlers:

```
npm run workers:dev
```

### Creating a new Flow Account on Testnet

In order to create an account on Testnet to deploy the smart contracts and mint Kibbles or Kitty Items, follow these steps:

- Head to https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/
- Sign up for `Creating an account`

### Creating a new database migration:

```shell
npm run migrate:make
```

Migrations are run automatically when the app initializes
